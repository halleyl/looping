    // Description:

    // When complete, this program will ask the user how many roller coaster rides
    // they'd like to go on, then execute a block of code that many times.
    // The block will output which "ride" they're on, and change which image
    // is displayed on the page. The images shown will cycle through a list
    // of possible sources, though this happens so quickly that the user will only see
    // the final one shown.

    // There are explanatory comments thoughout. The work that still needs to be done
    // is noted in TODO comments. Please complete this work.

    // an array of possible image source values
    var imageSources = [
      "http://images.mentalfloss.com/sites/default/files/styles/width-constrained-728/public/503373-iStock-186293315.jpg",

    // select the <img> tag with id of "roller" from the HTML
    var theImg = document.querySelector("img#roller");

    // set the src attribute of the img to be the first element in source array

    // Otherwise, do the loop!
    else if(howMany != 1) {
      // Execute loop HALF as many times as the user requested
      howMany = howMany / 2

      // Added modulo to check whether half their original value ends up as a non-integer
      // Explain that we're rounding up to a number in 2nd paragraph
      if (howMany % 1 != 0) {
        document.querySelector("#par2").innerHTML = ("We threw in half a ride for free, though!")
      }
      // If they enter an odd number, round the halved value up to an integer
      howMany = Math.ceil(howMany)

      // Explain to the user in first paragraph why they only get half the rides
      document.querySelector("#par1").innerHTML = ("Sorry, we can only give you half the rides you asked for. So we'll ride " + howMany + " times.")
    }
    
    // If user enters 1, just tell them that they get 1 ride to make things simpler (since half of 1 rounded up is still 1)
    else {
      document.querySelector("#par1").innerHTML = ("Okay, here you go!")
    }
    
    // TODO: execute this loop the number of times user requested
    // Done! - LH (with user requested amount halved, per Extra Challenge)
    while(howMany > 0){
      console.log("Wheee! This is the ", counter, " time we've done this!");
      howMany = howMany - 1
      // find value of counter modulo length of sources array-
      // this value will increase by one on each iteration of the loop,
      // so image source will cycle through all possible images
      var theOne = counter % imageSources.length;
      // reset the src of the image to the next member of the sources array
      theImg.setAttribute("src", imageSources[theOne]);

      // TODO: increment the counter
      // Done! - LH
      counter = counter + 1
    }

    // EXTRA CHALLENGES:
    // 1. Using JS, add a class of "red" to the <h1>.
    //    This only needs to be done once, so code should be outside loop.
    // 2. Execute the loop only half as many times, or twice as many times, as the user requested.
    // 3. Add a pause to each loop, so user can see each image as it cycles past.
    //    This is a difficult one!
